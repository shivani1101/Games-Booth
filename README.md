Static pages that can be found within the website would be the login and registration page. 

The dynamic page within our website would be the “Popular Games” page. This page displays a list of games where the order depends on how the user chooses to sort them. The user page is also a dynamic page as it displays the information about the user logged in. My SQL was used to store the popular games data and user login profile informations 

Within the register page of our website users are able to fill out a form and may leave 2 inputs blank which are province and city. The rest of the inputs are checked with the “empty” function in php and an alert would appear on screen notifying them. 

For the login page, users must sign in with a valid username and password that exists within the database. If it does not exist, the user would not be able to proceed into their user profile. 

Jquery was used in leaderboard php to give visual animation upon loading up the page. The result would be the leaderboard table coming into view one row at a time (one player’s score at a time). 

CSS was used to make the web pages responsive for all screen sizes. Media query was set for some pages to take into account different screen widths. In addition to css, bootstrap was used to automatically take care of the other responsive designs.
